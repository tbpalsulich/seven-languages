I am working my way through Seven Languages in Seven Weeks by Bruce A. Tate.
The book covers Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, and Haskell.
By the end of it, I should have a grasp of the capabilities and limitations 
of each language. But, I will not be fluent.
I have never worked with any of the languages before.
